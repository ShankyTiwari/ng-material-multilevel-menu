<div class="module-demo">
    By default, the method
    <code>
        <strong>selectedItem()</strong>
    </code>
    will emit the node which is currently selected either via routing or by a click. But there is an option to stop listening to this event if you want.
    <br>
    You can add one more property called
    <code>
        <strong>dontEmit</strong>
    </code>
    in the node object as shown below.
    <br>
    <pre>
        {{codeSnippet}}
    </pre>
    This property will apply to the current node only, it won't apply to its children nodes. The default behavior will be the same if you won't provide the
    <code>
        <strong>dontEmit</strong>
    </code>
    property.
